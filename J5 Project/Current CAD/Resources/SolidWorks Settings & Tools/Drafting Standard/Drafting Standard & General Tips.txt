I.) Drafting Standard

	i.) ANSI vs. ISO
		I don't intend for the section to lead way to a heated debate, but I believe this choice is in good reason.

		The major reason I impress upon my fellow members an ANSI-based standard, is the fact that the vast majority of hardware (fasteners, bearings, and so forth) used on the project conform
		to ANSI/ASME/ASMT specifications -- or in other words -- various Americanized standards. Roughly ninety percent of our hardware-related components are specific to the ANSI inch.

		Another reason is that the original robot is clearly designed with the inch in mind, and in America.

		This does NOT, in any way, shape, or form, mean that you should not or cannot switch to Metric within SolidWorks and work with what you are comfortable with.

	ii.) Settings
		Note: Some of these settings may not actually be contained within the .sldstd files, as SolidWorks seems to be very choosy about what is saved to them.
		      However, using the macro I have made will apply all the settings below.

II.) General Tips & Notes

	i.) Imperial & Metric Switching
		In SolidWorks 2014, we now have the ability to change Units from Imperial to Metric and vice versa from the bottom right of the status bar.
		After some testing, it appears that changing this from the bottom right has the same effect as changing it through Document Properties for the current file.
		Thus, it can be concluded that either changing this setting from the bottom right or from Document Properties is acceptable practice.

	ii.) Trailing Zeroes
		When it comes to complex parts and fully defined sketches, screen space is valuable. Especially for drawings, where every inch of paper is extremely valuable, and "clutter" is the enemy.
		As far as drawings go, I firmly believe we don't need "5.1000" to be shown as such. "5.1" would do just fine.
		This small change can mean a world of difference in cases where you must fit "5.1000" in a tight spot between sketch entities.

		Examples:
			"2.000000"   = "2"
			"2.675000"   = "2.675"
			"2.00000001"   = "2.00000001"
			"2.000000089"  = "2.00000009"
			"2.000001838"  = "2.00000184"
			"2.0000000008" = "2"

	iii.) Three Different Standard Files? Why Not One?
		If you open a part, assembly, and drawing, and look through each of their Document Properties, you will see that there are different options presented.
		
		In parts and assemblies, most of the options are the same, but there are some subtle differences, specifically under Units and Image Quality.
		In drawings, there are actually completely different options presented that pertain only to drawing files.

		If you look at the file sizes between these three files, they are indeed different down to the byte. Thus it can be concluded that their contents are different as well.
		With this in mind, I saved the settings for each file type as three separate files to be on the safe side.

	iv.) Determining if a File is using the Settings as Described Above
		1.) Open the Document Properties for the file.
		2.) Click on "Drafting Standard" should it not be already chosen.
		3.) If this reads as "Input-Inc _____ Drafting Standard", where "_____" matches the type of file that is open, then everything should be in OK shape.

		Should the Drafting Standard not read this:
		A.) Option #1
			1.) Click "Load From External File..."
			2.) Choose the appropriate .sldstd file for the file you have open.

			Note: It should be noted that this option does NOT apply Image Quality and *some* Unit settings to the file, as it appears SW is VERY picky about what is saved within .sldstd files.

		B.) Option #2
			1.) Run the "Apply Image Quality [All Types]" macro as described in "Macro Information & Usage.txt", Section III.
