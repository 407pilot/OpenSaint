This version, while aesthetically pleasing and relatively simpler, does not produce the same amount of lift as the original.

Because the "Base Rod", "Tie Bar", and "Banana Plate" are all inline with each other, this causes a significant reduction (upwards of 5 degrees) in the
maximum height the Lower Torso can achieve compared to the movie (within the first 6 minutes when all 5 SAINT robots salute in unison). The "Base Rod" hits
the large concave radius on the Side Plates of the Lower Torso, and the Banana Plate becomes almost concentric with the Tip Toe Tube. The major limiting
factors are the Base Rod, and the fact that all points are inline.

Note Banana Plate concentricity to the Tip Toe Tube is fine and probably desired. In V2 that will be attempted, or avoidance of the tube/screws altogether.

In the original version, because the Tie Bars are on the outside of the Lower Torso Side Plates, and given the Banana Plate and Tie Bars are offset by
around 7/8" to 1" (the small L-shaped bracket), allows the Lower Torso to actuate higher. The limiting factor (read: collision) then becomes between the
small L-shaped bracket and the 3" Bearing Collars, which in turn requires more thrust to reach, giving us more lift.

The original requires a cutout for the Tie Bar motion on the covering, viewable from the rear. While my artistic side normally prefers "form over function"
in most cases, this one stands out too much to ignore and I have to side with "function." It may be possible to put the Tie Bars on the inside, and I will
keep that in mind for another version. As such, V2 will more closely resemble the original for now until I can figure it out.
